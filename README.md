By [Bob Starr](http://www.rtzaudio.com).

## Description
The **DRC-1200** project contains the source code for the RTZ Audio DRC-1200 
digitial remote control for vintage Ampex MM-1200 professional studio
recorders. This source code was built with the following Texas Instruments
tool chain:

Code Composer Studio v6.2.0.0005, ARM Compiler Tools v16.9.1, TI-RTOS v2.16.0.08 

This code provides a remote transport control and auto-locator functions
to the MM-1200 transport. It requires the DTC-1200 transport controller
to perform the basic transport functions. The DRC-1200 is a remote wired
controller that uses RS-422 and the communications interface to the machine.
